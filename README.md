<h3>What does it do and what need does it fulfil?</h3>
The project is created by using skills I have acquired during the several months of studying coding after work, to create a portfolio website while utilizing HTML, CSS and JS. The purpose of the website is to allow user to see my previous projects, download cv and get into contact by filling out a form.

<h3>UX</h3>
<ul>
As a user I want to...
<li>View projects both in GitHub and Live. There are buttons to do so.</li>
<li>Download CV. Buttons for that exist in 2 places on site.</li>
<li>Esily get in touch. Contact button in the top will direct user to the form.</li>
<li>Change colors of the website theme. Buttons for that have been created and selection is stored for future visits.</li>
</ul>
